Both --hive-delims-replacement "null" and --hive-drop-import-delims did not work untill --map-column-java col4=String was added. That mean whichever column you want delims switch to work, it has to be java String type.


Use --map-column-java option to explicitly state the column is of type String. Then --hive-drop-import-delims works as expected (to remove \n from data).
