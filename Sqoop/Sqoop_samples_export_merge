# To export updated/new data to MYSQL

1. Create file and add some records.

$ vi departments_test;

[cloudera@quickstart ~]$ cat departments_test;
7,fanshop
9000,testing

# I renamed the file

[cloudera@quickstart ~]$ mv departments_test departments_export;


# Create a directory in HDFS

[cloudera@quickstart ~]$ hadoop fs -mkdir /user/cloudera/sqoop_import/departments_export

# Now put the file departments_export to that dir

hadoop fs -put /home/cloudera/departments_export /user/cloudera/sqoop_import/departments_export


NOw use sqoop export 

sqoop export --connect "jdbc:mysql://quickstart.cloudera:3306/retail_db" \
--username retail_dba \
--password cloudera \
--table departments_export \
--export-dir /user/cloudera/sqoop_import/departments_export \
--outdir java_files \
--direct \
--num-mappers 4 \
--update-key department_id \
--update-mode allowinsert \

# Here update-key should be unique or primary key &
update-mode as allowinsert or updateonly

Allow insert -- It will allow insert other than update
updateonly - It will allow update alone. By default, it is updateonly mode.

# The table has updated as follows

mysql> select * from departments_export;
+---------------+-----------------+
| department_id | department_name |

9 rows in set (0.00 sec)

Since the primay key is not present in the table,

it will newly insert the records(Duplicate records
are created).

To solve this issue, we need to use table with primary key


### staging

--staging-table ---> use to import data from HDFS before inserting into target table in order to check whether all the data has loaded successfully
--clear-staging-table ---> To clear all the data inside the table
 Staging is normally used when primary key of the table is not available. So while doing export, it will fail after try to export until 4 times. 

So the insert will fail. In such case, staging will be using

Note:  Update-key cannot run with staging-table
